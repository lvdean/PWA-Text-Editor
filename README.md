## Description
This weeks challenge was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. It features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## User Story
As developer I Want to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection so that I can reliably retrieve them for later use.

## Installation

Clone the repo: git clone SSH git@github.com:lvdean/PWA-Text-Editor.git

Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

Next, use the terminal to run the command `npm i` to install the dependencies associated with this application.

Run `npm run build` which generates an optimized version of the application for production.

To start the server `npm run start:dev`
